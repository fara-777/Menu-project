# Menu-project

I have created a responsive restaurant menu with filtering options using Bootstrap and JavaScript, allowing customers to select their desired meals. Below is a brief description of the project:

The restaurant menu has been designed using Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework that enables the creation of responsive and mobile-first websites. The use of JavaScript allows for the implementation of interactive features, such as filtering options that allow customers to select specific meals based on their dietary preferences or other criteria.

With this menu, customers can easily browse through the available dishes, filter them by various categories, and view detailed information about each item, including its ingredients, price, and any special features. The responsive design ensures that the menu looks great and is easy to use on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Overall, this menu provides a user-friendly and engaging experience for customers, making it easy for them to find and order the meals they want from the restaurant.
